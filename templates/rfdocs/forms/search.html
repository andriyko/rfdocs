    #TODO
    It would be good to have search terms (like version, library and tag)
    to be visually wrapped, like in Dash.app for keyword.
    That requires special hooks with css and js, one possible way
    to achieve this is to use `contenteditable` on div and emulate that div as `input` element.
    Then wrap terms within `span` tag and style them as needed.
    Too much work as for now.
